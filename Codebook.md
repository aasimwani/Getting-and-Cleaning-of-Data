#CodeBook for Getting and Cleaning of Data 

##Description 
This Codebook has been created which shows all the variables mentioned in the dataset given in the project and describes them.

##Information Regarding the Dataset 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear 
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the 
data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for 
generating the training data and 30% the test data.


##Variables 
After reading the tables into one file and combining them into one ,we get the following variables :
features.txt
activity_labels.txt
subject_train.txt
x_train.txt
y_train.txt
subject_test.txt
x_test.txt
y_test.txt
